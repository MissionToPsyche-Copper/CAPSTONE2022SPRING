# CAPSTONE2022SPRING

This is a part of the #21-A WebXR team, for NASA Psyche Project. It's meant to inform and entertain about the various aspects of the asteriod and the satellite to said asteriod, as well as it's name. 

This app was developed to be WebXR based, through a combination of css, HTML, glitch, and, most importantly, teamwork; for I would have had a much harder time without my team helping make this happen. 

The photos are from three seperate entities: the bufferfly I created myself, graphicdesignismypassion(2).png came from a 3D image created by Thom -exported to be a png by myself-, the graphic artist of our team, and the png of the Psyche Satellite was taken from ASU's website. 

Not much is needed to run the project; you can download both the files and run the .html file.

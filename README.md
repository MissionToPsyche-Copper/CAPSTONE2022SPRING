# CAPSTONE2022SPRING

This is a part of the #21-A WebXR team, for NASA Psyche Project. It's meant to inform and entertain about the various aspects of the asteriod as well as it's name. 

This app was developed to be WebXR based, through a combination of css, HTML, glitch, and, most importantly, teamwork; for I would have had a much harder time without my team helping make this happen. 

The photos are from two seperate people: the bufferfly come a royalty-free website Unsplash, created by Pırıl Osmanoğlu. The Object.png came from a 3D image created by Thom, the graphic artist of our team. 

Not much is needed to run the project; you can download both the files and run the .html file.
